NAME
    HTML::DisableForm - Manipulate disabled/readonly HTML Forms

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::DisableForm;

        my $df = new HTML::DisableForm;
        my $output = $dif->disable_form(scalarref     => \$html);

DESCRIPTION
    This module automatically makes form controlls disable/readonly.

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new HTML::DisableForm object

      $df = new HTML::DisableForm

  disable_form
    Returns HTML with disabled forms. This method can take some type of
    argument for a HTML document.

      $output = $df->disable_form(scalarref => \$html);

      $output = $df->disable_form(file => "/path/to/document.html");

      $output = $df->disable_form(arrayref => \@html);

    Specify readonly flag if you want to makes it readonly instead of
    disable.

      $output = $df->disable_form(arrayref => \@html);

    Suppose you have multiple forms in a html and among them there is only
    one form you want to disable, specify target.

       $output = $df->disable_form(
          scalarref => \$html,
          target    => 'foo',
       );

    If there are some forms you want to ignore, specify their names as
    ignore_forms.

       $output = $df->disable_form(
          scalarref    => \$html,
          ignore_forms => [qw/foo bar/],
       );

    You can also ignore fields what you want.

       $output = $df->disable_form(
          scalarref    => \$html,
          ignore_fields => [qw/name password/],
       );

  readonly_form
    This method equals to "disable_form()" with a readonly flag.
